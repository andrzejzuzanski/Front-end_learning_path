# Front-end_learning_path

I always wondered how the Internet works and how websites work, it was black magic to me and I thought it was very complicated and now (in the process of learning) I know that it is and that is why I like it so much. The constant solving of puzzles, the sinuous interweaving of things that can be understood in 15 minutes and such that I need days to learn and many different sources ensure that I can constantly learn new things.

In this repository I'll keep all the things I've learned about HTML, CSS and JS so that later I can either come back to them with a smile at how easy it all was to understand or to find out after hours of trial and error what basic mistake I made.
